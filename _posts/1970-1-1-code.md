```c++
#include <iostream>
struct Foo {
    int i;
    void A() {}
};
using FooFuncPtr = void (Foo::*)();
int main() {
    FooFuncPtr A{&Foo::A};
    //The next line output 2 on my machine, and if that is not your case, you are welcome to leave a command and discuss it with me.
    std::cout << sizeof(A) / sizeof(char*) << std::endl;
}
```
