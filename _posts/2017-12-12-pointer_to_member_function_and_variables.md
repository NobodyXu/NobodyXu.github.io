# pointer to member functions
## memory layout
The memory layout of member function pointers is actually a bit different from an ordinary pointer :
1. The size of it is twice as an ordinary function pointer. 
2. And what it stores is quite different, too. When I store a normal member function in it, the first 8 bytes(a 64-bit machine) 
seems to be the address of that member function. 
3. - When a virtual member function is stored in it, it actually holds 0x1, 0, which can't be the address of the function.
   -  So I guess that, the it might be stored as if it's a member variable pointer, it holds the offset of it, not the absolute
   - address. I defined a derived class from it and overload the virtual function, and what the pointer of it holds 0x0, 0.
